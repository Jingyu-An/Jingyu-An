# 👋 Hi, I'm Jingyu — Embedded Developer, System Programmer, and IT Security Engineer

I'm a software engineer based in Canada with experience across **embedded systems**, **full-stack development**, and **IT security**.  
My background includes **BSP (Board Support Package) development at LG Electronics**, full-stack engineering in a fast-moving startup, and currently **IT security operations for manufacturing plants through LG CNS America**, supporting NextStar Energy’s infrastructure.

I'm now deepening my expertise in **C programming**, **AAOS internals**, and **system-level engineering**, aiming to grow into automotive OS and embedded platforms.

## 🔧 Core Technical Focus (2025)
- **C programming** — memory, pointers, data structures, system-level debugging  
- **Embedded systems** — BSP, boot-process, HAL, device drivers  
- **AAOS (Android Automotive OS)** — Input / Display / Audio pipelines, HAL  
- **System fundamentals** — processes, threads, scheduling, IPC  
- **Security engineering** — infrastructure hardening, endpoint security, access control  
- **Algorithm practice in C**
