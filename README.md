👋 Hi, I'm Jingyu — Automotive OS & Embedded Systems Engineer

I am a systems-oriented engineer based in Canada, specializing in embedded C, Android Automotive OS internals, and low-level system software.
My background spans BSP development at LG Electronics, full-stack engineering in a startup, and IT security infrastructure for automotive manufacturing plants at LG CNS America.

Now, I am focused on building expertise in AAOS platform internals, HAL/driver development, and system-level performance engineering for next-generation in-vehicle systems.

🔧 Technical Domains I Work In
Embedded & System Programming

C programming, memory model, pointers, low-level data structures

Multithreading, concurrency, process scheduling, synchronization

Linux kernel fundamentals & driver concepts

Automotive OS (AAOS)

InputFlinger, SurfaceFlinger, AudioFlinger

Android HAL architecture & Binder IPC

Device bring-up, system services, USB & power management

Performance profiling for embedded Android environments

Security & Infrastructure

Endpoint security for manufacturing plants

Access control, device hardening, policy enforcement

OT/IT system reliability & compliance in automotive factories
