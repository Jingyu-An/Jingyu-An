# 👋 Hi, I'm Jingyu — Software Engineer focusing on System Programming, AAOS, and IT Security

I'm a software engineer based in Canada, currently working at **LG CNS America** as part of the **IT Security** team.  
Previously, I worked as a **Full-Stack Developer at Nemcco (2023–2024)**, building production-ready web applications and backend services for a fast-growing startup.

My current personal focus is deepening my fundamentals in **C programming**, **Android Automotive OS internals**, and **embedded/system-level concepts**.

## 🔧 Core Technical Focus (2025)
- **C programming** — pointers, memory, data structures, system calls  
- **System fundamentals** — processes, scheduling, IPC, OS internals  
- **AAOS (Android Automotive OS)** — HAL, Input/Display/Audio pipelines  
- **Security concepts** — endpoint security, infrastructure protection, access control  
- **Algorithm practice in C**
