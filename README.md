## 🔥 About Me

I am an engineer focused on **Embedded Linux**, **Automotive BSP**, and **kernel-level system software**.
My work spans **USB subsystem development**, **SoC bring-up**, **PMIC/power path integration**, and **low-level platform debugging**.

I began my embedded career at **LG Electronics**, owning USB BSP features for commercial devices such as **G5, G6, and V20**.
This included designing real hardware algorithms, integrating PMIC drivers, and supporting cross-functional debugging with HW teams.
Key contributions include:

* **Industry’s first commercial USB-C implementation (LG G5)**
* **Moisture detection & port-protection algorithm**, reducing port failures in field use
* **USB accessory authentication** for secure peripherals
* **USB-driven auxiliary display communication (V20)**
* **Kernel bring-up, PMIC integration, device tree configuration, and timing analysis**

Today, I’m building deep expertise in **AAOS BSP**, **HAL/driver pipelines**, and **Linux kernel subsystems** for next-generation automotive platforms.

## 🚀 Current Technical Focus (AAOS BSP / Kernel Engineering)

* **AAOS HAL → Driver → Kernel flow** 연구 및 구현
* **SoC bring-up fundamentals**: clocks, pinctrl, regulators, power domains, device tree
* **Linux kernel driver model**: probe/bind, IRQ handling, PM states, runtime PM
* **USB subsystem deep-dive**: Type-C roles, PD negotiation, descriptors, gadget/host stack
* **PMIC & charging path analysis** across multiple hardware revisions
* **Binder IPC & AIDL patterns** for automotive HAL layers
* **System-level C optimization**: memory, latency, concurrency, lock-free patterns

### 🐧 **Linux Kernel & BSP Engineering**

**Subsystems I’ve worked with:**

* **USB core**, Type-C, PD policy engine, role switching
* **PMIC framework**: regulators, ADC paths, battery/charging logic
* **I/O subsystem**: GPIO, pinctrl, I2C/SPI device bring-up
* **Power Management**: suspend/resume, runtime PM, wake sources
* **Init/Boot**: device probing, uevent flow, service bring-up sequence

**BSP Experience:**

* Configured and validated **Device Tree (DT)** nodes for USB/PMIC
* Resolved timing mismatches between DT configuration and HW revision changes
* Performed cross-team debugging using kernel logs, dmesg traces, and PMIC registers
* Integrated vendor kernel patches and maintained feature compatibility
