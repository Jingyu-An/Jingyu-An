## 🔥 About Me

I’m a systems-focused engineer with experience spanning **embedded BSP development**, **Android Automotive OS internals**, **3D web systems**, and **automotive manufacturing infrastructure security**.

My engineering foundation was built at **LG Electronics**, where I developed USB BSP features for flagship devices such as the **G5, G6, and V20** — including **the industry’s first USB-C implementation**, **moisture detection**, **USB authentication**, and **USB-driven auxiliary display support**.

Since then, I’ve expanded into **full-stack + 3D rendering systems**, and currently support **secure automotive plant environments**.

I’m passionate about building **reliable, deterministic system software** that runs close to hardware.

## 🚀 Current Focus Areas (2025)

* Deep-diving **AAOS internals**: InputFlinger, SurfaceFlinger, AudioFlinger
* Practicing **system-level C**: memory, concurrency, data structures
* Exploring **USB subsystem flows (enumeration, HAL, power, PD)**
* Building engineering repositories:

  * `embedded-c-labs`
  * `automotive-aaos-notes`
  * `os-systems-playground`

## 🧠 Technical Strengths

### 🔧 **Embedded & System Programming**

* C, pointers, memory model, low-level data structure design
* Multithreading, scheduling, synchronization
* Linux kernel basics, drivers, boot process, debug workflow

---

### 🚗 **Android Automotive OS (AAOS)**

* Flinger subsystems (Input / Display / Audio)
* AIDL, HAL, Binder IPC
* System service flows & power management

### 🔌 **BSP USB Engineering (LG Electronics)**

Worked on flagship models **G5, G6, V20** with responsibilities including:

* **World’s first commercial USB-C integration on G5**
* **Moisture detection & protection logic** (USB port water sensing + shutdown policy)
* **USB authentication for accessories & peripherals**
* **Auxiliary Display via USB communication** (V20 Second Screen)
* **Device bring-up, kernel-level debugging, and PMIC/USB driver integration**

These experiences shaped my strong foundation in **embedded C**, **hardware–software interfacing**, and **system-level reliability**.

### 🌐 **3D Web Systems (Nemcco)**

Built a large-scale **3D mining-field visualization platform** using:

* **React + React Three Fiber (R3F)** for real-time 3D rendering
* **Three.js** scene optimization & interaction logic
* **Node.js + Express (MERN)** for backend data pipelines
* **3D mining site simulation** with dynamic state updates and user interaction

This strengthened my **rendering pipeline**, **real-time system**, and **performance tuning** experience.
