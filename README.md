## 🔥 About Me

I am an engineer specializing in **Embedded Linux**, **Android Automotive OS BSP**, and **low-level system software**.
My experience spans **kernel-level USB subsystem development**, **SoC bring-up**, **power & PMIC integration**, and **automotive manufacturing system security**.

I began my embedded career at **LG Electronics**, developing core USB BSP features for flagship devices including **G5, G6, and V20**.
My work included:

* **Industry’s first commercial USB-C implementation**
* **Moisture detection & port-protection algorithm**
* **USB accessory authentication**
* **USB communication for V20 auxiliary display**
* **Kernel bring-up, PMIC integration, and driver-level debugging**

Today, I’m building deep expertise in **AAOS BSP**, **HAL/driver integration**, and **Embedded Linux platform engineering** for next-generation automotive systems.
