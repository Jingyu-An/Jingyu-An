# 👋 Hi, I'm Jingyu — Software Engineer focusing on Automotive OS, Embedded Systems, and C Programming

I'm a software engineer based in Canada, currently working at **NextStar Energy** and previously at **LG Electronics**.  
My background spans **automotive software**, **embedded systems**, and **full-stack development**, and I'm now specializing in **AAOS (Android Automotive OS)**, **system programming in C**, and **low-level OS concepts**.

I enjoy building things from the ground up — understanding how systems work internally and continuously leveling up my fundamentals.

## 🔧 Core Technical Focus (2025)
- **C programming** — memory, pointers, data structures, low-level debugging  
- **Embedded / Automotive Software**  
- **Android Automotive OS (AAOS) internals**  
- **HAL, IPC, system services, and Linux kernel concepts**  
- **Algorithm study in C (LeetCode + system-level problems)**  

---

## 🚗 Professional Background
- **Software Engineer @ NextStar Energy (Canada)**  
  Working on automotive and energy software systems

- **R&D Engineer @ LG Electronics (Korea)**  
  Experience with large-scale products, system integrations, and cross-functional engineering work

- **John Abbott College Projects (2022-2023)**  
  Completed various full-stack, Java, and C# projects (archived for reference)

---

## 📚 Current Learning & Projects
- **AAOS internals study** (Input, Display, Audio pipelines)  
- **Vehicle HAL concept & communication flow**  
- **C language deep-dive** (build my own libraries, algorithms, and memory tools)  
- Creating my **`aaos-c-study`** and **system-programming playground** repositories

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**Languages:**  
C, Java, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python  
**Frameworks:**  
Android/AAOS, Spring Boot, .NET, React  
**Tools:**  
Linux, Git, Docker, Postman, VS Code, Rider, IntelliJ  

---

## 🌱 Goals for 2025
- Build advanced AAOS practice repositories  
- Strengthen C systems knowledge (kernel, processes, scheduling)  
- Work on automotive-related open-source contributions  
- Prepare for future opportunities in **U.S. automotive & embedded engineering**
